Similarly we can also implement any arbitrary unitary evolution using just CNOT, Hadamard, Phase and $\\pi/8$ gates upto an arbitrary level of accuracy. It is important to understand that one cannot represent every unitary evolution since they exist over a continuous set of variables hence could require an infinite number of these gates to execute."

    "\n",
    "So firstly here are some hints, this unitary will require no more or less than 5 $H$ gates and that is all you know. The rest of the required gates are obviously $T$. An obvious approach is to try multiple combinations till the norm difference reaches a very small amount and for that at every trial you can use the good old <code>qi.Operator(circuit).data</code> to get the unitary of the circuit at that moment. If you want to re initiallize your circuit i.e. clear out all the gates, then simply do <code>qc3 = QuantumCircuit(1)</code> again.\n",
    "\n",
