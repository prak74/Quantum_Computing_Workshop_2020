# Quantum Computing Workshop 2020

Welcome to our Quantum Computing workshop. The main aim of this workshop will be to introduce some concepts of quantum computing and implement them using **Qiskit**, an open source python library developed by IBM for simulation of quantum computers. This is a very fun and useful library for anyone wanting to run quantum computing workshops and it is also quite accessible.

We will be covering the basics of quantum computing and introducing to you some of the important algorithms of quantum computing and guide you to also executing them on a basic scale. In the very end you will be given two interesting problems to solve, so we hope you enjoy those :)

## Starting up

So to start off you need an IBM id so that you can use the IBM Quantum Experience.

You can find the IBM Quantum Experience [here](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).

If you are familiar with github or have github desktop we recommend cloning the repo to your computer or if you arent familiar with github then you can simply download as zip by clicking at the green **Code** button above and select **Download ZIP**. You will have to of course download it again as we update more notebooks in here.
To download the notebooks individually you have to select **Raw** button and then save as on that page and you will have to choose the save as in *all files* and it would automatically come as Notebook_name.ipynb.txt so you have to save it as just Notebook_name.ipynb by removing the .txt from the extension. In case your computer doesnt allow you to actually change extensions, you can open it in notepad or any text editor and save as in *all files* and keep the .ipynb extension and you will be done.<br>
Alternatively you may also choose to open [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and here select the **Github** tab and enter the link of this repo and it will list all the notebooks in this repo and you can then proceed to download from there however we will strongly recommend you to not use google colab as you may face errors. 

Once you have set up your account you can use the notebooks provided to you by going on the side tab on [this](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) page and selecting **Qiskit Notebooks** under the Tools section and selecting **Import** and simply uploading the notebooks that you have downloaded from here.
If you wish to run these notebooks locally you will require **Anaconda** and **Jupyter** which comes by default along with **Anaconda**.

You will also require the packages **numpy**, **scipy**, **matplotlib** and **os** but these come included with **Jupyter** anyway.<br>
To install qiskit follow [this guide](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html). Note that you will also need to store your IBM credentials locally as a .json file to run these notebooks locally.

Once you are done with all this you can start with the notebooks :)

[Day 5 BB84 Protocol](https://github.com/mnp-club/Quantum_Computing_Workshop_2020/blob/master/Notebooks/Day%205%20BB84%20Protocol.ipynb)<br>

The notebooks of the following days will be added soon so stay tuned.

**Note:** the markdown texts may look a little messed up on the github preview but on downloading it will be completely fine.

If you are facing troubles you can ask your doubts on the [telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/R8Z5FhfzigvZWYIxTrz6Zw).<br>
For additional references you will find the [Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html) to be quite handy and also [this youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2q1PuI2RFI&list=PL1826E60FD05B44E4) does a pretty good job at explaining some basic concepts for quantum computing.

All our sessions will be recorded so in case you are unable to attend them, do not worry since the recordings will be provided to you and we are always available for clearing your doubts via the telegram group.

There will be two talks from guest lecturers:<br>
Sandesh Kalantre, Graduate Student, University of Maryland on *Quantum Computing: The Present and The Future* at 7 PM, 26th July<br>
Apoorva D. Patel, Professor at the Centre for High Energy Physics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore at 7 PM, 2nd August

We hope you have fun and learn something new :)
